            <p class="intro-text">Welcome to Recipes! I know it can be a struggle to figure out what to eat everyday. 
                So I've made a collection of some of my favorite recipes.
                Whether you are cooking for yourself or your family, these recipes can easily be scaled up or down either way. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">All you have to do is head over to the recipes tab and you can pick whichever meal sounds the best!</p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Life gets really busy, whether you're a college student learning to cook on your own, or a parent juggling a hundred things at once. This collection was made with simplicity in mind. Every recipe here uses everyday ingredients and straightforward steps, so you can spend less time stressing in the kitchen and more time enjoying your food.
